It returns a boolean value indicating whether it's possible or not.\n\n**Important notes:**\n\n1. This function is mostly used internally, so you might not need to call it directly.\n2. The logic for adding instances is based on an internal property called `OCCURRENCES` and another property called `REQUIRED_ATTRIBS`.\n\nNow, let's dive into the code:\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   `parent`: The parent element to which we want to add a new instance of `Class`.\n*   `set`: An optional parameter that specifies the set (not used in this specific implementation).\n*   `raiseexceptions`: A boolean flag indicating whether to raise an exception if the instance can't be added.\n\n### Flow\n\n1.  The function first checks if the parent element accepts instances of `Class` using another method (`accepts`). If not, it immediately returns `False`.\n2.  Next, it checks two conditions:\n\n    *   **Occurrence limit**: It counts how many instances of `Class` are already present in the parent element (without considering sets). If this count exceeds `OCCURRENCES`, and we're raising exceptions, an error is raised.\n    *   **Set occurrence limit**: If `set` is provided and `REquired_ATTRIBS` is set, it counts how many instances of `Class` are already present in the specified set. If this count exceeds `OCCURRENCES_PER_SET`, an error is raised.\n\n### Return values\n\n*   If all checks pass, the function returns `True`.\n*   If any check fails (except for the initial `accepts` check), it returns `False`.\n\nIn summary, this function helps prevent duplicate instances of a class from being added to another element based on certain conditions and limits.",
